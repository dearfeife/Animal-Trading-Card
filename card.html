			<div class="fact">
			<p>Some say that the corgi is an “enchanted dog” favored by fairies and elves.
			   At night the magical creatures would use the dogs to pull their carriages and be their steeds in battle. 
			   According to legend, the markings on a corgi’s coat suggest the faint outline of a saddle and harness.

			<p>Pembroke Welsh corgi's are achondroplastic, a dwarf breed with shortened legs. They are the shortest breed of the herding dog group. 
			   A fanciful tale is that the fairy saddle markings seen on their backs are due to them being ridden by fairies.</p>
